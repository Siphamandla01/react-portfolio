# Wanna Add Bootstrap?


The first step is to go to your terminal and type:

### `npm install bootstrap`



Then import Bootstrap CSS and optionally Bootstrap theme CSS in the beginning of your `src/index.js`

### `import 'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.css';`

Once this process is completed, you can go ahead and start using the built-in Bootstrap classes in React app! Now Let's have fun :smile: :smile:
